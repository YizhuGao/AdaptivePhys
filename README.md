## Bayesian Knowledge Transfer

BKT Algorithm Implementation (Code editor: Jupyter Notebook)

## Meeting Minutes

### System Design

- The system is implemented in Angular 18.1.1.
- Code Editor: Pycharm

## How to Run the System on Your Local Computer

1. Clone this Git Repository
2. Install Pycharm
3. Open the AdaptivePhys project in Pycharm
4. Open the terminal in Pycharm
5. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd AdaptivePhys
    ```
6. Start the Angular development server:
    ```sh
    ng serve
    ```
7. Open your browser and go to:
    ```sh
    http://localhost:4200/adaptive-phys
    ```

## Future Work

- Integrate BKT algorithm into Adaptive Phys System
- Implement result analysis functionality
